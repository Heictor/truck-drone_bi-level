% --- This function would contain the full implementation of ACO for the lower level ---
% --- and CMA-ES for the upper level. Below is a simplified conceptual structure. ---

% 1. Initialize ACO parameters (pheromone levels, evaporation rate, etc.)
% 2. Start main ACO loop (for number of generations/ants)
%    a. For each "ant":
%       i. Construct a solution (a path through the truck network nodes)
%          probabilistically, based on pheromone levels.
%       ii. The first N nodes in the path become the parking spots.
%       iii. For this set of parking spots, calculate the total JTruck cost by
%            calling the CMA-ES solver for each drone mission.
%    b. Update pheromone trails: increase pheromones on paths from good solutions
%       and let all pheromones evaporate slightly.
% 3. End loop

% For now, we return placeholder values
overall_fleet_cost = rand() * 100 + 40; % Random cost for demonstration
parkingSpots = []; % Placeholder
