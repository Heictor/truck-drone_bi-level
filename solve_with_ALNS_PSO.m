% --- This function would contain the full implementation of ALNS for the lower level ---
% --- and PSO for the upper level. Below is a simplified conceptual structure. ---

% 1. Initialize ALNS parameters (temperature, cooling rate, etc.)
% 2. Generate an initial random solution (assignment of parking spots)
% 3. Start main ALNS loop (while temperature > min_temp)
%    a. Select "destroy" and "repair" operators
%    b. Create a new solution by partially destroying and repairing the current one
%    c. For the new set of parking spots:
%       i. Loop through each truck
%       ii. Call the PSO solver for the drone's PID tuning
%       iii. Calculate JTruck cost
%    d. Use simulated annealing to decide whether to accept the new solution
% 4. End loop

% For now, we return placeholder values
overall_fleet_cost = rand() * 100 + 50; % Random cost for demonstration
parkingSpots = []; % Placeholder
